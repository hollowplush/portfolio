      <p>I <i>love</i> listening to music. I do it all the time in order to find inspiration for my characters and stories.
        One day, I stumbled upon a song called "Bitter Choco Decoration",
        a Japanese vocaloid song which received an English cover by one of my favorite cover artists.</p>

      <p>I listened to the song a bit more thoroughly and realized it fit one of my stories incredibly well.
      In a wave of motivation, I decided I wanted to recreate this music video.
        It was quite a task and nothing I had attempted before, but I was determined to try.</p>

    <p>I began analyzing the video. Everything that moves needs to be its own image so that I can edit it later.
    Not only that, but I needed to mess around with some color schemes and make sure I find a fitting palette for this project.
    It's not supposed to be a very colorful like my usual style, but luckily I found a palette I was happy with.</p>

    <p>I began redrawing all the assets I saw while inserting my own characters and giving it my own spin.</p>

    <p>It took many layers and a lot of effort. Knowing myself, I had to try and finish all of this in a few days.
      Otherwise, I was sure to lose motivation and leave the project unfinished. I really did not want this to happen...</p>

    <p>As you can see, there are many grouped layers. Every group makes for 1 asset, consisting of the line art and a coloring layer.
    This way I recreated all the scenes and was able to switch between them easily by hiding or showing certain layer groups.</p>

    <p>I really like this fullbody art in particular :) I think it turned out good!</p>

    <p>Anyway, more and more assets...</p>

    <p>Even more! I made this symbol into a flower even though it's a circle of some sorts in the original.
      The chromatic aberration is a little different as well, because I liked these colors a little better.
      They look a bit more fitting with the flower symbol, in my opinion.</p>

    <p>A lot of these layers make use of the symmetry tool.
      It allows you to draw two lines simultaneously and create a perfectly symmetrical image that way.
      Not only that, but it is also very useful for checking if your image is centered.
    That is what the black line through the middle of the canvas represents.</p>

    <p>Some images are only used for a split second, such as this one.
    I enjoyed drawing it, though! I always enjoy drawing something edgy... Don't tell.</p>

    <p>I was struggling a tiny bit with this frame because I initially made it too small.
      I forgot to consider the fact I had to zoom it out in a later frame.
      I luckily managed to fix it, and it looks fine now.
    Just a small detail nobody likely ever noticed.</p>

    <p>I loved creating these tiny scenic images. I rawdogged them, meaning I used no extra layers for them.
    I simply went straight to coloring, considering they don't use any line art.</p>

    <p>It was fun to mess around with the colors and chromatic aberration.</p>

    <p>This is an image which will be obscured by two black boxes during editing.
      This means I don't have to worry about the neatness of the art. It will be hidden anyway.</p>

    <p>Finally, we reached the end of drawing all the assets...</p>

    <p>Time for the editing. Though, I realized I enjoyed drawing this outfit a lot. I also love the color scheme.
    So, I made a small doodlepage.</p>

    <p>It would have been much better for me to make this <i>before</i> I drew all the assets...
      I would have had a nice reference sheet to work off of.</p>

    <p>I boot up my editing software (VN Editor on iPad) and get to work.
      I load in all the assets and recreate every scene I see, adding movement to them as I do, keeping the video next to me as reference.</p>

    <p>My iPad is a little old, so it struggled a bit and became hot rather fast... But, I believe in my iPad.
    It has lasted so long, I trust it can handle this as well. (Though I was a little worried it wouldn't.)</p>

    <p>When I finally edited all the images and movements, I began adding the lyrics. Let me tell you, I was incredibly frustrated.
    When I entered all the lyrics, almost done, the file got weirdly corrupted. I managed to save the images and motion, but the lyrics were gone.</p>

    <p>I needed a moment to calm down, but I spitefully re-entered all the lyrics and made sure to save it plenty of times.
    Finally, the video was finished! It was 3 days of hard work, but I'm happy with what I managed to make in 3 days.</p>
