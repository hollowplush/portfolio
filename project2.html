    <p>For my first project, I’d love to share this mage Kore piece.
      I like how it turned out and I loved working on it too! It was very fun :)</p>

    <p>For those unaware, Kore is a character I created a few years ago based on the Greek goddess Persephone.
      It got wildly out of hand and I have multiple different universes for him, including a medieval DnD-esque one with lots of mages!</p>
