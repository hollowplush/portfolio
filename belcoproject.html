    <p>All humans need to bite the dust in order to learn. This is a project which greatly demotivated me for a multitude of reasons... But also allowed me to reflect.</p>

    <p>Many people assume that I simply "didn't like the project", or that I didn't give it my all because it was boring - that's not true.
      I'm not someone who gives up easily. I can be rather stubborn, even.
      I really tried my best, but sometimes, <span class="highlighted_words">things don't go the way you want them to.</span> It's important to share those moments as well.</p>

    <p>Our class was chosen to work for <span class="highlighted_words"><a href="https://belco-edu.com/">Belco Alliance.</a></span> We listened to their (vague) presentation, viewed their (outdated) site, and formed groups.
      It was promised to us that their <span class="highlighted_words">brandguide</span> would be uploaded online. We began brainstorming a little bit as the entire class waited for the guide to come online.</p>

    <p>We collectively set up a <span class="highlighted_words">research proposal</span> and <span class="highlighted_words">planning.</span> Initially, we all wanted to research our own question and throw our information together, but our teacher advised us to focus on one question with the entire group.
      We picked my question to focus on.</p>

  <div class="rightProjectColumn project2_paragraph">
    <p>Still waiting for the brandguide to be uploaded, we decided to focus on <span class="highlighted_words">researching the target audience.</span>
      We created a <span class="highlighted_words"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScwedI9tOJFWrOefh19NjUQ0Ph1DUuh94gEYBnr8flTjOsijA/viewform?usp=dialog">questionnaire,</a></span> which we sent around.
      We got only 6 responses, unfortunately... So, two of our group members were tasked with doing real life interviews in order to get more responses.
      They only got 1 extra response. This is where I began feeling unhappy with this project.</p>

    <p>We were not making as much progress as I wished we were. The brandguide had still not been uploaded, time was ticking.
      Being a student, I did not feel like I was in the position to pressure the president of a whole organization to hurry up posting their brandguide.
      The first presentation neared, we had to show <i>something.</i> We were certain it wasn't our fault that we did not have their brandguide yet.</p>

  <div class="rightProjectColumn project2_paragraph">
    <p>During the weekend, I quickly brainstormed and created a <span class="highlighted_words">very simple design for the homepage</span> so that we at least had <i>something</i> to show them.
      We also decided to ask them about the brandguide during the presentation, which would be the first time we would meet again.</p>

    <p>The presentation came, and... <span class="highlighted_words">They were disappointed.</span> They expressed this very clearly and in a rather rude way. I, too, was disappointed in this project.
      We asked about the brandguide and were told we "should have asked", even though that is not what they told us. They also said it wasn't a "real brandguide" and moreso a few PNGs.
      Needless to say, I was very pissed and rather disappointed in this project. The promised was not fulfilled and they blamed us for it.</p>

    <p>In hindsight, I should have taken initiative and pressure them about the brandguide. I was too scared back then. I wish I could tell myself to step it up and be more assertive.</p>

    <p>After that whole ordeal, our entire group was unmotivated and annoyed. I felt wronged (very neurodivergent of me) and needed to collect myself.
      However, I managed to do that and began working on a <span class="highlighted_words">more extensive website design.</span> Initially, we all wanted to make our own designs and put them together.
      In the end, I was the only one who worked on the design... Which sucked a bit. I became <span class="highlighted_words">stressed out</span> by all the work I was taking on myself because I was too scared to speak up.</p>

    <p>At least I know now to be clearer and more assertive next time. I should probably try to be the project leader and see if that gives us better results.</p>

    <p>A project partner and I created this little <span class="highlighted_words">assets sheet</span> (can't find the proper name...) for our site. It's small, but neat.

    <p>Then, we did another assignment in class, which was <span class="highlighted_words">user testing</span> with our teacher. For some reason, I was chosen to be the one carrying out the test (speaking to the tester).
      I am very scared of public speaking, and this was something the entire class would see. I don't like how our project looked either.
      But in the end, I survived, and I learned that it's important to <span class="highlighted_words">connect</span> to your testers and make sure their experience is a positive one.</p>

    <p>Besides those assignments, not that much happened...
      I mainly spent time working on the <span class="highlighted_words">Figma design</span> and personally stressing out over how bad this project was going.
      The communication in our group was terrible, I didn't understand what was going on very well during the project and everything was new to me.
      I've always had trouble understanding what is asked of me. This project solidified that. Next time, I will ask for help more often.</p>

    <p>Time passed, and eventually it was time for our final presentation. It sucked. I had accepted defeat by this point. We were disappointed, Belco was disappointed, the teacher was disappointed.
      Nobody liked this project, but at least we were done, right...?</p>

      Well, at least we could refresh our focus and leave the designing stage behind. Right now, all that mattered was the <span class="highlighted_words">coding.</span>
