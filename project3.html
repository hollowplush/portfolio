      <p>I've always had much respect for <span class="highlighted_words">animation</span> of any and all kinds. One artist I look up to particularly much is James Baxter,
      an animator who has animated multiple beautiful shots for Disney and other studios. After watching some of his animation reels,
      I decided I felt inspired to try some detailed animation as well.</p>

      <p>I've already done multiple simple animations and animatics in the past - check out my own <span class="highlighted_words"><a href="https://youtu.be/CH6_UwMDbBI">animation reel.</a></span>
      However, I never had the motivation nor tools to work on animations with heavy shading and all that.
        Coincidentally, <span class="highlighted_words">Procreate Dreams</span> had just released not too long ago, and I realized I might get pretty far using it.</p>

    <div class="rightProjectColumn project2_paragraph_reverse">
      <p>Next came the <span class="highlighted_words">coloring,</span> likely my less favorite part.
      It takes long, it's tedious, and it's difficult to color fur markings and such.</p>

      <p>I wish Procreate Dreams was a better animation program, because it's actually awful for doing the <i>actual animations</i>.
        I do the animation in <span class="highlighted_words">Procreate,</span> and do the shading, lighting, and other effects in Dreams.</p>

      <img src="images/project3-3.gif" class="rightProjectImage">
      <div class="rightProjectColumn project2_paragraph">
        <p>Finally, I finished the coloring. Free at last. Now, the fun can start.</p>

        <p>I exported the <span class="highlighted_words">gif</span> from Procreate and imported it in Dreams.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="project2_content_reverse">
      <img src="images/project3-4.png" class="leftProjectImage">
      <div class="rightProjectColumn project2_paragraph_reverse">
        <p>I tried to create a <span class="highlighted_words">background</span> in Dreams initially, when I realized I was struggling too hard over it and switched back to Procreate to do it.</p>

        <p>It is simply a still image, so no problems there.
          I spent the evening making a background and referenced <span class="highlighted_words"><a href="https://a.storyblok.com/f/178900/1060x596/a4c6f3f6ef/puella-magi-madoka-magica-the-movie-walpurgisnacht-rising-madoka.jpg/m/filters:quality(95)format(webp)">this image</a> for it.</span></p>

        <img src="images/project3-5.png" class="rightProjectImage">
        <div class="rightProjectColumn project2_paragraph">
          <p>I put an image of the gif on top of it to make sure it all aligns well and doesn't become too messy or crowded.</p>

          <p>A <span class="highlighted_words">background blur<span class="highlighted_words"> works wonders for keeping the focus on the main subject.</p>

        <div class="rightProjectColumn project2_paragraph_reverse">
          <p>Finally, I could ACTUALLY begin working on the <span class="highlighted_words">shading and lighting.</span> For each frame, I added some simple shadows,
          and I put some gradients over the gif. Adding the lighting was my favorite part. I love making art look shiny and light.</p>

          <p>In the background, I decided to add some <span class="highlighted_words">floating petals.</span> This helps sell the idea there's wind, despite the background image not moving.
            I ended up needing a lot of <span class="highlighted_words">layers,</span> displayed on the <span class="highlighted_words">timeline</span> below.</p>

          <div class="rightProjectColumn project2_paragraph">
            <p>Procreate Dreams's <span class="highlighted_words">exporting</span> is not good. I had to save the different frames individually and use the gif option in Procreate.
            Of course, this also wasn't perfect. It ended up looking pretty crunchy and pixelated.</p>

            <p>After a lot of trial and error, I found that it looks less bad when exporting a <span class="highlighted_words">bigger canvas.</span>
            So, I created a canvas as big as I could and stopped tinkering with it. I also learned about GIFs as a whole.
            Initially, I didn't know they simplify colors to save on resources...</p>

      <p class="project_intro">It was fun to make this, but also time-consuming. I learned a lot though, and I'm very happy with
      my first detailed animation like this. I have a better understanding of all the work that goes into animation, which has boosted
      my appreciation of art even further.</p>
