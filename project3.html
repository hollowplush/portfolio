      <p>I've always had much respect for animation of any and all kinds. One artist I look up to particularly much is James Baxter,
      an animator who has animated multiple beautiful shots for Disney and other studios. After watching some of his animation reels,
      I decided I felt inspired to try some detailed animation as well.</p>

      <p>I've already done multiple simple animations and animatics in the past - check out my own <a href="https://youtu.be/CH6_UwMDbBI">animation reel.</a>
      However, I never had the motivation nor tools to work on animations with heavy shading and all that.
        Coincidentally, Procreate Dreams had just released not too long ago, and I realized I might get pretty far using it.</p>

      <p>Next came the coloring, likely my less favorite part.
      It takes long, it's tedious, and it's difficult to color fur markings and such.</p>

      <p>I wish Procreate Dreams was a better animation program, because it's actually awful for doing the <i>actual animations</i>.
      I do the animation in Procreate, and do the shading, lighting, and other effects in Dreams.</p>

      <div class="rightProjectColumn project2_paragraph">
        <p>Finally, I finished the coloring. Free at last. Now, the fun can start.</p>

        <p>I exported the gif from Procreate and imported it in Dreams.</p>

        <p>I tried to create a background in Dreams initially, when I realized I was struggling too hard over it and switched back to Procreate to do it.</p>

        <p>It is simply a still image, so no problems there.
          I spent the evening making a background and referenced <a href="https://a.storyblok.com/f/178900/1060x596/a4c6f3f6ef/puella-magi-madoka-magica-the-movie-walpurgisnacht-rising-madoka.jpg/m/filters:quality(95)format(webp)">this image</a> for it.</p>

          <p>I put an image of the gif on top of it to make sure it all aligns well and doesn't become too messy or crowded.</p>

          <p>A background blur works wonders for keeping the focus on the main subject.</p>

          <p>Finally, I could ACTUALLY begin working on the shading and lighting. For each frame, I added some simple shadows,
          and I put some gradients over the gif. Adding the lighting was my favorite part. I love making art look shiny and light.</p>

          <p>In the background, I decided to add some floating petals. This helps sell the idea there's wind, despite the background image not moving.
          I ended up needing a lot of layers, displayed on the timeline below.</p>

            <p>Procreate Dreams's exporting is not good. I had to save the different frames individually and use the gif option in Procreate.
            Of course, this also wasn't perfect. It ended up looking pretty crunchy and pixelated.</p>

            <p>After a lot of trial and error, I found that it looks less bad when exporting a bigger canvas.
            So, I created a canvas as big as I could and stopped tinkering with it. I also learned about GIFs as a whole.
            Initially, I didn't know they simplify colors to save on resources...</p>

      <p class="project_intro">It was fun to make this, but also time-consuming. I learned a lot though, and I'm very happy with
      my first detailed animation like this. I have a better understanding of all the work that goes into animation, which has boosted
      my appreciation of art even further.</p>
