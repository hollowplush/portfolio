        <p><em>#expectations</em><br>
          I went to the We Are Playgrounds event with school today! At first, I was pretty nervous...
          Most of you know I'm not a big fan of travelling, nor do I handle big crowds very well. And sitting through lectures...
          Eugh. However, I was excited about the guests that would be attending!</p>
          <p><em>#experience</em><br>
            My love for art made me able to go (despite my anxiety), and I hoped I could learn a lot - which I did!!
          I already knew a lot about the art-related things, but I feel like it was a good step for me socially.
          I spoke to Feefal (I've loved her work for many years!) and got her art book, which she signed!
          Absolutely one of my prized possessions now.
            I wish I could have attended Aaron Blaise's panel, but I couldn't, since his panel was rather late.
          I watched a lot of Brother Bear as a child, and it inspires me to this day.</p>
          <p>I hung out with friends as we made our way through the event.
          It felt like the other conventions I've been to, giving me a comforting sense of familiarity.
          I was blown away by the amazing art they had on display, and I bought some very cute stuff at the artist alley <3
        Support small businesses! <br>
            I left in the afternoon after feeling overstimulated.</p>
        <p><em>#reflection</em><br>
          I had seen most of the event and didn't feel like sticking around for the later panels.
        It was a very fun day though, I hope to go again next year <3 I bet they have amazing artists then as well!</p>

  They're basically goals. I'll explain all five individually and show how I meet the requirements.</p>

    <h3><em>VTube model:</em></h3>
      <p>I have created a VTube model for somebody else as part of an art trade. They made me multiple pieces of art in return for one VTube model. <a href="images/Screenshot%202025-04-12%20144939.png" target="_blank">(Image 1)</a>
    <br>Once I had confirmation of the static avatar being correct, I continued with rigging the model. <a href="images/lo1-2.gif" target="_blank">(Image 2)</a><br>
    Once that was done, I only had to add physics to the model. <a href="images/lo1-3.gif" target="_blank">(Image 3)</a><br>
    Of course, I made sure to give them a guide so they don't struggle too much with getting it to work. Looking back at the guide, I feel like I could have been more clear, telling the user where to download the program and specifying "this file", which was the attached model file.<a href="images/Screenshot%202025-04-12%20151027.png" target="_blank">(Image 4)</a>
      <b>ADD VTUBE STUDIO RIG MAP!!! and preferably a little gif of a moving face next to the model, to highlight interactivity</b></h3>
    <br><br>
    <h3><em>This site:</em></h3>
      <p>Secondly, this entire site also serves as an example of interactive media. I love trying to incorporate as many fun things as I can.
    Of course, this site was not created to be like this right off the bat. The initial idea stems from semester 1, where the site was supposed to help users create their own fictional characters. <a href="images/web6.png" target="_blank">Image 5</a> shows the very first idea.
     We were assigned to create a site based on our interests, which I listed above in the image.</p>
    <p>I even created a little bunny mascot for the site, seen in <a href="images/web7.png" target="_blank">image 6.</a> Since I revamped the site to be focused on myself, I had no need for a site mascot/helper character anymore, and so the bunny was scrapped.</p>
  <p>In semester 2, we needed to create portfolio sites. I had no idea what to go for and remembered the site idea I had in semester 1. I looked it up once more and looked at the possibilities of changing the intent of the site.
    I figured it could definitely work as a cute portfolio site with some changes and edits, so I got to work and created new wireframes.

    <h3><em>Using Git:</em></h3>
    <p>I'm learning how to use Git. I've never understood it before, but I'm slowly beginning to get the gist of it.
    I have continuously uploaded my versions to a repository. <a href="images/Screenshot%202025-04-12%20151644.png" target="_blank">(Image 1)</a> <a href="images/Screenshot%202025-04-12%20152836.png" target="_blank">(Image 2)</a></p>
    <br><br>
    <h3><em>Coding:</em></h3>
    <p>Here is the code for this website. I used HTML <a href="images/Screenshot%202025-04-12%20153250.png" target="_blank">(Image 3)</a>
    , CSS <a href="images/Screenshot%202025-04-12%20153335.png" target="_blank">(Image 4)</a>
    , and JavaScript <a href="images/Screenshot%202025-04-12%20153348.png" target="_blank">(Image 5)</a>.<br>
    For CSS and JavaScript I used W3Schools as reference. At one point I couldn't get the JavaScript to work as I wanted it to, so I asked ChatGPT for help.<br>

    <h3><em>Morphienn's persona:</em></h3>
    <p>Morphienn wanted a character design that she could use for her branding. She wants this character to be based on herself and portray herself through the character.
    I looked through her social media profiles and through the Pinterest moodboard she created for her own branding, leading to creating <a href="images/mor1.png" target="_blank">image 1.</a>
    On the side of the image, I wrote her feedback down in bullet points. There are parts she wanted to be removed, possible edits/additions and also things she really liked.</p>
    <p>I created new sketches where I implemented her feedback. Take a look at <a href="images/mor2.png" target="_blank">image 2</a>, where the feedback is once again written on the side.</p>
    <p>I once again used this feedback and began working on the final design. I made a sketch and showed it to Morphienn, who saw nothing that needed to change. Her only feedback was that it was beautiful. Please see <a href="images/mor3.png" target="_blank">image 3.</a></p>
    <p>I finished the sketch and had it approved by Morphienn. Please look at <a href="images/mor4.png" target="_blank">image 4.</a> She loved the colors and requested no further changes.</p>

    <h3><em>Communication with Morphienn:</em></h3>
    <p>Please click the images to see them in full size. <br>
    I communicated clearly with the client, Morphienn. We navigated together in order to find the perfect persona for her.
    She sent me sources of inspiration which I was able to use throughout the process, which really helped me create the product she wished for.
    Morphienn was a wonderful client and I loved working with her.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3><em>User testing:</em></h3>
    As a group, we have carried out a user test, using a prototype of our website.

      I watched a lot of Brother Bear as a child, and it inspires me to this day.</p>
    <p>I hung out with friends as we made our way through the event.
      It felt like the other conventions I've been to, giving me a comforting sense of familiarity.
      I was blown away by the amazing art they had on display, and I bought some very cute stuff at the artist alley <3
      Support small businesses! <br>
      I left in the afternoon after feeling overstimulated.</p>
    <p><em>#reflection</em><br>
      I had seen most of the event and didn't feel like sticking around for the later panels.
      It was a very fun day though, I hope to go again next year <3 I bet they have amazing artists then as well!</p>
