# portfolio

This is the portfolio of Malou Bruil, online name ishybun/Mint.

This is a website created for a school project.

This is my first time creating a website, and one of my first experiences with coding in general, so there's bound to be errors and bugs. However, I had a lot of fun learning and gaining experience, happily creating something I love.

I hope you have a fun time looking around the site and messing with some of the features it has. Personally, I enjoy using the homepage as a digital fidget toy.

This site can always be improved. There are a few issues I am aware of, such as inefficient code and making things too complicated for myself. Still, if you find any errors, I'd love to hear about it.
