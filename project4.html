    <p>Before summer vacation ended, me and my friend decided to buy 2DSes together, as a fun little project before we lose the amount of free time we had.
    My signature color has always been a dark blue and hers had always been orange. Luckily, 2DSes exist in those colors!</p>

    <p>I wanted to make matching themes for us using our persona characters.
      I researched the sizes of the top and bottom screens and sketched up two designs, one for each of us.
    I showed it to my friend, and she loved it.</p>

    <p>Here is a quick look at all the layers. There did not have to be that many, but it did make designing easier.
    It's more convenient to alter colors and tweak little things that way without affecting the entire piece.</p>

    <p>My 2DS is blue and black, while hers is orange and white. I tried to reflect this in the themes in order to make them fit the device.</p>

    <p>I cleaned up both the themes' top screens. It took a few tries to get right, but I managed to make it work in the end.</p>

    <p>I like how it turned out. I used a gradient map to get the themes to match properly.</p>

    <p>Now, I had to actually put the theme on our 2DSes. This requires CFW (Custom FirmWare), meaning we have to mod our 2DSes.</p>

    <p>Neither of us had hacked anything before, but we heard it shouldn't be too difficult. She got a friend of ours to help her,
    while I decided to tackle it on my own. I wanted to learn more about it and have the experience, especially considering I was going to study IT after the vacation.
    Luckily... There's a nice <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/">guide</a> that I was able to follow. It took a little while, but I managed to get it working!</p>

    <p>Now, I get to actually turn the theme into a readable file for my 2DS. I do this using Kame Editor, a program specifically made for this.</p>

    <p>It's a little confusing to figure out, and I wish I had been able to decorate it more prettily, but I was quite drained by this point.
      So, I did what I could and called it a day.</p>

    <p>And my friend's theme works as well! Even nearly a year later, we both love our themes so much, and we're happy every time we see them. :)</p>

<p class="project_intro">All in all, I think this was a fun project to work on. I learned a lot about programming and how to organize files!
I also learned that programming/hacking isn't all that scary. I found the process very interesting, and I'm looking into doing the same with my WiiU!</p>
